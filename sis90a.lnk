Silicon Integrated Systems SiS900 Another NDIS 2.0.1 MAC driver 1.03
====================================================================

1.Introduction

SiS900 seems to be the NSC DP83815 variation, to be custumized 
to M$ Windows Wake-On-LAN. The registers of the chip is almost 
same as that of DP83815.
I've modified NSC DP83815 Another driver into SiS900 driver.

SiS provides the offcial driver SIS900.OS2, that is included in 
sl114.zip. You can download it on the SiS web site.

Included files are:
sis90a.os2	NDIS 2.0.1 MAC driver
sis90a.nif	Network Information File
sis90a.sym	Symbol Map file
sis90a.lnk	Document (this file)
source.zip	source files
tool.zip	mac address query tool. source and binary.

You could download the latest file on the gomi:NDIS MAC Drivers page,

2.No Warranty

This code is provided 'AS IS' and any warranties are disclaimed.
Use your own risk.


3.Considerable configuration keywords

There is a restriction among TXEARLY(TxDrth), TXFLTH and TXMXDMA.
  FIFOsize(2KB) - TXEARLY >= TXFLTH > TXMXDMA
Be careful if you want to modify these parameters.


4.Note

- No test on SMP environment. (I gess it can work.)
- Wake-On-Lan is not supported. No plan.
- The tested chip revision is 02 only.
- I hear that no EEPROM is available in some implementations.
   Set MAC address by hand with NETADDRESS keyword.


5.Redistribution with modification

Your should add your copyright notice, 
"(c)Copyright 2005 your name. All rights reserved."
